 Project Overview
This project is designed to explore and visualize a comprehensive movie metadata dataset using Microsoft Excel and Power BI. It aims to uncover hidden patterns and relationships in box office performance, viewer preferences, and production trends across different countries and genres. Through a well-structured dashboard, stakeholders can gain insights into profitability, audience engagement (via IMDb scores), social media influence (Facebook likes), and technical production factors such as duration and format. These visual analytics support data-driven decision-making for movie producers, marketers, and analysts.
